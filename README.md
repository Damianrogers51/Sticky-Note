# Sticky-Note

This web application is a useful study aid that allows users to create and save their own set of virtual flashcards and sticky notes. These notes can store both 
text and images, allowing users to save different types of information which can then be quickly accessed and altered later. Users are also given the opportunity 
to alter the color and size of each note they create, as a means to group information together.
